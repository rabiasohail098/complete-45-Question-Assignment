//Question 32
//Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a 
//unique username.
//• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
//• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the
// current_users list.
//• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message 
//that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that
// the username is available.
//• Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.

let current_users = ["arsalan","Rafay","suleh","Ayan","Sohail"];
let new_users = ["sohail","Arsalan","Hammad","Fakhir","Humair"];
new_users.forEach((new_one_user =>{
    let our_condition = current_users.some(current_one_user=>current_one_user.toLowerCase()===new_one_user.toLowerCase())
    if (our_condition){
        console.log(`Sorry ${new_one_user} is already been used`)
    }else{
        console.log(`This username ${new_one_user} is available`)
    }
}))

//Question 33
//Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a array, such as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers
//end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
//• Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a array.
//• Loop through the array.
//• Use an if-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number. Your output should 
//read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.

let ordinalNum: number[]= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
for (let a=0;a<ordinalNum.length;a++){

    if (ordinalNum[a]==1){
        console.log(`${ordinalNum[a]}st`);
    }else if(ordinalNum[a]==2){
        console.log(`${ordinalNum[a]}nd`);
    }else if (ordinalNum[a]==3){
        console.log(`${ordinalNum[a]}rd`);
    }else if(ordinalNum[a]>=4 && ordinalNum[a]<=9){
        console.log(`${ordinalNum[a]}th`);
    }}


//Question 34
//Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, and then use
// a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
//• Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the
// pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni
// pizza.
//Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza. The output
// should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such 
//as I really love pizza!


let mypizza: string[] = ["Cheese Pizza","Pepporoni Pizza","Vageterian Pizza"];
for (let i=0;i<mypizza.length;i++){
    console.log(`${mypizza[i]}`);
}
for (let a=0;a<mypizza.length;a++){
    console.log(`I really like to eat ${mypizza[a]}.`)
}
console.log("I really like to eat pizza. Pizza comes in a variety of flavors and topping, allowing individuals to"
+" customise it to their liking");

//Question 35
//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these
//animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print
//a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program 
//stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make
// a great pet!

let mypet: string[] = ["Buffalow","Sheep","Cow","Goat"];
for (let b=0;b<mypet.length;b++){
    console.log(`${mypet[b]}`);
}

for (let p of mypet){
    console.log(`${p} is a domestic animal.`);
}
console.log("These animals would make a great pet!");
