//Question 26
//Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
//• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
//• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
//• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

//Question 28
//Stages of Life: Write an if-else chain that determines a person’s stage of life. Set a value for the variable 
//age, and then:
//• If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
//• If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
//• If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
//• If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
//• If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
//• If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
