//Question 36
//T-Shirt: Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed
// on the shirt. The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on 
//it. Call the function.

function make_shirt(size: number ,label: string)
{ return `My shirt size is ${size}  and my label is ${label}`;

}
let myfun = make_shirt(36,'"The sunny day"');
console.log(myfun);


//Question 37

// a different message.

function make_shirt1(label:string,size:string = "Large"){
return `${size} ${label}`
}
let myfunc= make_shirt1("I love TypeScript")
console.log(myfunc)

function make_shirt2(label:string,size:string = "Medium"){

function make_shirt3(size:string, label:string){

    //value. Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the default country.

    function describe_city(nameofcity:string,country:string="pakistan"){
        return `${nameofcity} is in ${country}`
    } 
    let city1 = describe_city("Karachi");
    let city2 = describe_city("Lahore");
    let city3 = describe_city("Multan");
    let city4 = describe_city("Dubai" , "USA");
    console.log(city1);
    console.log(city2);
    console.log(city3);
    console.log(city4);
